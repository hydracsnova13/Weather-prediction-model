# Weather-prediction-model
This project applies machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) to predict rainfall in Australia using the weatherAUS.csv dataset, with evaluations via Mean Absolute Error and result visualizations for enhanced insights.

Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict weather conditions, particularly focusing on rain-related predictions in Australia. Using the weatherAUS.csv dataset, the project explores various stages of data processing, including cleaning, transformation, and analysis, to prepare the data for effective model training.

Key Features
Data Processing and Cleansing: The project begins with thorough data processing, including handling missing values and removing outliers, to ensure data quality and reliability.
Data Visualization: Exploratory data analysis is conducted with visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
Feature Selection: Key features like location, temperature, and rainfall are carefully selected to predict whether it will rain today, tomorrow, or the amount of rainfall.
Model Development: Three different machine learning models – Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) – are employed to predict various aspects of rainfall.
Model Evaluation and Selection: Models are evaluated based on their Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to determine the most accurate predictor for each target variable (RainToday, RainTomorrow, and Rainfall).
Prediction and Analysis: The project involves making predictions about future weather conditions and visualizing the results for better understanding and decision-making.
Technologies Used
Python, with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for data visualization, Scikit-learn for machine learning models, and TensorFlow for LSTM models.
Jupyter Notebook as the development environment to facilitate code testing and visualization.
Project Structure
Data Import and Cleaning: The initial phase involves importing the dataset using Pandas and cleaning it by handling missing values and outliers.
Data Transformation: Non-numerical data is converted into numerical formats using label encoding, making it suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Model Training and Evaluation: Separate models are trained for predicting 'RainToday', 'RainTomorrow', and 'Rainfall'. Their performance is evaluated using MAE, and the best model for each prediction task is selected.
Result Visualization: The results are visualized using bar plots and confusion matrices to provide insights into the model's performance and the data's characteristics.
Prediction Table Creation: A comprehensive prediction table is created, summarizing the predictions for various cities.
Usage
The project can serve as a reference for those interested in applying machine learning techniques in meteorological data analysis. It can also be adapted or extended for similar datasets or to explore other machine learning models.

Future Scope
Implementing more sophisticated data preprocessing techniques.
Experimenting with additional or different sets of features.
Exploring other machine learning and deep learning models.
Deploying the model as a web application for real-time weather prediction.
